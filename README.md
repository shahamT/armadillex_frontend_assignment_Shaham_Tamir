# Companies DB - Frontend Developer Assignment Starter

👋 **Welcome, Developer!**

Thanks for taking on this assignment! This is a Vue 3 + Quasar starter project that's been set up with all the tools and architecture you'll need. We've structured it to mirror how we build real features at Armadillex.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Get Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
quasar dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:9000`

## 🛠️ What's Already Set Up

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **Quasar Framework** for UI components
- **Vue Query** (@tanstack/vue-query) for state management
- **Vue Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API calls
- **SCSS** for styling
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable Vue components
├── pages/         # Route-based page components
├── router/        # Vue Router configuration
├── services/      # API services and business logic
├── stores/        # Composables for state management
└── css/           # Global styles and variables
```

## 🎯 Development Approach

1. **Start with the data** - Check out the existing company service structure
2. **Build incrementally** - The routing and basic architecture is ready
3. **Use Quasar components** - They're already configured and themed
4. **Think real-world** - Build like this is going to production

## 🧰 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run format   # Format code with Prettier
```

## 💡 Tips

- The project uses Vue 3 Composition API - leverage `<script setup>` syntax
- Quasar provides excellent components out of the box
- Vue Query is set up for API state management
- Check the existing code structure before creating new patterns - and improve what-ever you see fit.
